## About the website

[Harrods](https://www.harrods.com) is an iconic British institution thats globally renowned for its luxury retailing. Originally founded by [Charles Henry Harrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Henry_Harrod) in 1849, this upscale department store sits in the heart of Londons posh Knightsbridge district. With its motto "Omnia Omnibus Ubique" which translates to "All Things for All People, Everywhere," Harrods prides itself on providing an unrivaled selection of high-end products and services. However, Harrods does not have a stock market listing, thus it does not have a stock symbol or an initial public offering (IPO) date, or a market capitalization at IPO. More details about Harrods, its history, and operations can be found on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods).

Harrodss main competitors in the luxury retail market include [Selfridges](https://www.selfridges.com) and [Fortnum & Mason](https://www.fortnumandmason.com). Selfridges, founded by [Harry Gordon Selfridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Gordon_Selfridge) in 1908, prides itself on offering a visionary approach to retail, with its flagship store located on Londonâ€™s Oxford Street. On the other hand, Fortnum & Mason, famed for its high-quality groceries, was founded by [William Fortnum and Hugh Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnum_%26_Mason) in 1707. Like Harrods, neither Selfridges nor Fortnum & Mason are listed on the stock exchange, hence they do not have Bloomberg pages. More details about these competitors can be found on their respective Wikipedia pages for [Selfridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfridges) and [Fortnum & Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnum_%26_Mason).
